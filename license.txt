NON-COMMERCIAL USE LICENSE

One of the primary goals of academic researchers is to advance the state-of-the-art in their fields of endeavor. This is done through sharing their results with  peers who will evaluate the merits of the works and build upon them in future research. Therefore, it is important for academic researchers who write original source code to be able to share their code. However, sometimes this source code can have commercial value. Revenue generated from licensing the code benefits the researcher and their lab as well as the university, which is able to reinvest that money into new research projects and resources.

The Non-Commercial Use License addresses the former group who will use the source code for non-commercial purposes only.
