## Week 02.02: A crash course in plotting data

### Dr. Bitterman

# Today's schedule

- Open discussion
- Writing your own function
- Exercises in programmatic and systematic thinking

---

## Anything to discuss? Questions?

---

# Remember "our first function"?

### syntax is a bit weird, so let's break it down
```r
myfirstfunction <- function(x, y){
  return(x + y)
} 
```

### then call the function (make sure it's in memory first)
```r
myfirstfunction(4, 8)
```

# Today's task: the importance of programmatic/algorithmic/systematic thinking

---

# Task 1: 

- In small groups, figure out how you'd do the following:
- Write a function that takes two integers. If **both are even** or **both are odd**, the function returns **TRUE**. Otherwise, it returns **FALSE**
- FIRST, do it ON PAPER
- THEN, implement it in code

---

# Task 2:

### The problem:

- I've given you a raster file of Missisquoi Bay in Lake Champlain (assume you can read it with: ```raster::raster("file name and path go here")```)
- Each cell has a value corresponding to the concentration of cyanobacteria
- I want you to tell me the area of the Bay (in m<sup>2</sup>) that correspond to the following health risk categories from the World Health Organization
  - Low: < 0.0002 micrograms/L
  - Medium: >= 0.0002 and < 0.001 micorgrams/L
  - High: >= 0.001 and < 0.1 micrograms/L
  - Very high: >= 0.1 micrograms/L

---

## The big picture questions:
1. What do the algorithm(s) look like?
2. What other information do you need?
