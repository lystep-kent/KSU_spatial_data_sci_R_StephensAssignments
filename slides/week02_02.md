## 

## Week 02.02: A crash course in plotting data

### Dr. Bitterman

## 

---

# Today's schedule

- Open discussion
- Plotting
- Exercises

---

## Anything to discuss? Questions?

---

# Why do we plot our data?

### (I know it's a bit of a silly question, just go with it)

---

# Many methods, we'll focus on two (but really on 1)

1. "base R"
2. ggplot

---

# Setup

- Open RStudio, start a new project (or use the one from last class)
- Make sure you have ```ne_counties.csv``` from last class

### Today's packages
```r
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```
### read the data, remind yourself what it loiks like
```r
mydf <- read_csv("./data/ne_counties.csv")
glimpse(mydf)
```
---

# Some simple base R plots

### the "plot" function can be used in multiple ways
```r
# scatter plot
# should be highly correlated
plot(mydf$Total, mydf$TotalUnits)
```
### What do you see?

```r
# scatter plot #2
plot(mydf$Total, mydf$PerCapInc)
```

---

# Let's try a histogram

```r
# histogram
hist(mydf$PerCapInc)
```

### and exert a bit more control
```r
# change the number of breaks
hist(mydf$PerCapInc, breaks = 20)
```

---

# ggplot
### Let's build a plot step-by-step

---

# the setup

### 
```r
# the initial call
ggplot(mydf, aes(x = Total, y = PerCapInc))
```
### What happened?

---

# Let's add a geom

### Wait, what's a "geom"???

```r
ggplot(mydf, aes(x = Total, y = PerCapInc)) +
  geom_point()
```
### Note the "+" ...it's a very different notation

### and we can modify the points:
```r
ggplot(mydf, aes(x = Total, y = PerCapInc)) +
  geom_point(colour = "blue")
```

---

# And alter the theme

```r
ggplot(mydf, aes(x = Total, y = PerCapInc)) +
  geom_point(colour = "blue") +
  theme_minimal()
```
### Try a different one! How would you know what options there are for themes?

---

# Add some labels

```r
ggplot(mydf, aes(x = Total, y = PerCapInc)) +
  geom_point(colour = "blue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Total Population", y = "Per capita income")
```

---

# ...and add a title

```r
# and give it a title
ggplot(mydf, aes(x = Total, y = PerCapInc)) +
  geom_point(colour = "blue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Total Population", y = "Per capita income",
       title = "My first ggplot")
```

---
# fit a line

### don't just throw arbitrary models/fits on your data
```r
ggplot(mydf, aes(x = Total, y = PerCapInc)) +
  geom_point(colour = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", colour = "red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Total Population", y = "Per capita income",
       title = "My first ggplot")
```

---

# Let's try something different

---

# Using categorical data
### (first, we have to make some categories) - let's walk through this code

```r
mydf2 <- mydf %>% mutate(sizeCategory = ifelse(Total > 20000, "big", "small"))
```

### check your work:
```r
summary(mydf2$sizeCategory) ### What happened?

# turn them into factors to count them
summary(as.factor(mydf2$sizeCategory))
```

---

# A first example

### Let's break it down:
```r
ggplot(mydf2, aes(x = Total, y = PerCapInc)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = sizeCategory, colour = sizeCategory), size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Total Population", y = "Per capita income",
       title = "My formatted ggplot")
```
### what happened?

---

# One more example:

# a pipe with a boxplot
```r
mydf2 %>% ggplot(., aes(x = sizeCategory, y = PerCapInc)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = sizeCategory)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Categorical size",
       y = "Per capita income", 
       title = "I made a boxplot",
       subtitle = "it's handy")
```

---

# If there's time, try it yourself:

### using ggplot:
- Make a histogram
- Make a histogram of Females with advanced degrees (multi-step process)
- Try a barplot...
  - subset of the counties (however you want)
  - counties on the x-axis, number of vacant uints on the y-axis

---

# Review and next class

- Any questions?

- This weekâ€™s readings/tasks: 
  - Chapter 2 in textbook
  - Continue to review Hadley's book/site
  - Practice on your own
