0. Watch this video (which you are)
1. First, download and install the R computing environment (just get the most recent one): https://www.r-project.org 
2. Next, install RStudio Desktop, the IDE we'll use this semester. It's a user-friendly (well, more friendly at least) way to create projects https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

# More next class (also on Canvas page)

3. If you don't already have a GitHub account, sign up for one. https://github.com 
4. Then, get your GitHub Student Developer Pack. It grants you a LOT of FREE stuff: https://education.github.com/pack/join 
5. We'll talk about git and GitHub in class, but there are many ways to use it. The command line is popular and powerful, but there is a steep learning curve. There are many free and paid software options as well. GitHub Desktop is one of them https://desktop.github.com , but feel free to use your Google-Fu and find something that you like
