# Reflection activity (3-5 min)

1. **WRITE DOWN** 2-3 things you can *now* do that you couldn't when the semester started
2. On the first day, you were asked what "success would look like" at the end of the semester. Were you successful?

## Pair-and-share (find a buddy)

### Share: 
- your new skills
- your favorite thing about the course (e.g., new skills, activities, labs, demos)
- your measure of success *and* how well you did

# Learning objectives (from the syllabus)

By the end of the term, students will be able to successfully:

- Demonstrate a familiarity with the R programming language in the context of geospatial analysis
- Write self-contained functions to automate geospatial tasks
- Analyze model workflows and describe computer code and algorithms in plain language
- Create small-scale programs that interface with web-based tools
- Practice good programming practices
- Plan, develop, and execute a programmatic analysis of a dataset

### How did you do?
