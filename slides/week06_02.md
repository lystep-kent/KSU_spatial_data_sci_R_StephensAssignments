# Next week

- I will be traveling, so no class
- However, I have posted a link to Lovelace, ch 4 on Canvas
    - Read the chapter
    - Work through the exercises
- Lovelace chapters 4 & 5 will form the foundation for much of our work over the next 3-4 weeks

# It's important that our code be readable, reproducible

- In group/collaborative settings, you'll have to read the code of others
- So today, you'll read some of MY code
- And interpret it

---

# About the code

- It contains functions AND procedural code that uses those functions
- It WAS a bit old, but I have updated it to reflect new packages and paradigms
- It relies on data that I have added to `/data/erie_cicyano/`

---

# About the GitHub repository

- Let's talk strategies
- Clone vs. fork vs. downloading the repo vs. downloading only what you need

---

# Your task

- In the "/src" directory of the course repo, find the "code_reading_ex.R" file
- I've stripped most of the comments from the document
- Your tasks...
    1. look at the code (and comments) to understand the "flow" of the code
    2. then, go through the code, line-by-line
    3. think about what the code is doing, then test it
    4. fill in the comments (behind the "#") with what the code does

- You can run it at any time up to any step
- I'm assigning teams

---

## For next week

- Chapters 4 here: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-operations.html 
- Practice, practice, practice
- Lab 02 - keep working
