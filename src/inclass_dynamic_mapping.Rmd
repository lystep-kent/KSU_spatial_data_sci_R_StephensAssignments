# Today's schedule

- Open discussion
- Intro to Leaflet (https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)



Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(terra)
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)
```

# Leaflet

Leaflet is....

...a Javascript library with an API we can access in R. 

Wait, that's a LOT of jargon. Can we add some clarity?

```{r}

```

## Features
- Interactive panning/zooming
- Compose maps using arbitrary combinations of:
    - Map tiles
    - Markers
    - Polygons
    - Lines
    - Popups
    - GeoJSON
    
## Functionality
- Create maps right from the R console or RStudio
- Embed maps in knitr/R Markdown documents and Shiny apps
- Easily render spatial objects from the sp or sf packages, or data frames with latitude/longitude columns
- Use map bounds and mouse events to drive Shiny logic
- Display maps in non spherical mercator projections
- Augment map features using chosen plugins from leaflet plugins repository

# Demonstration

A simple setup

```{r}
m <- leaflet()

m
```

What do you get?


Let's try again

```{r}
m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles()

m
```

And now? What do you see?


Let's build on that

```{r}
m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng = -81.350903, lat = 41.150377, popup="Our McGilvrey Hall GIS Lab")

m
```

What about now?

## Let's add some complexity

Create some data to plot. Let's break this down a bit. What am I trying to do?

```{r}

# First let's define a color palette we can sample from - this is only really necessary for the demo
mypal <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(12, "Set3")

# start with a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  lat = rnorm(100) * 2 + 41,
  lng = rnorm(100) * 2 - 81.5,
  size = runif(100, 5, 20),
  color = sample(mypal, 100, replace = T)
)

# then add the data frame to a leaflet map
m2 <- leaflet(df) %>% addTiles()

m2
```


What do you get? Why?

How can we interrogate the properties/attributes of an object?

The `$` operator

```{r}
m2$x
```

What do the data look like?


Let's try again to visualize it. Again, break down the code first

```{r}
# first one
m2 %>% addCircleMarkers(radius = ~size, color = ~color, fill = FALSE)

# second one
m2 %>% addCircleMarkers(radius = runif(100, 4, 10), color = c('red'))

```

What happened this time???

Let's add some more tiles

```{r}
# Let's check out some other tiles

m <- leaflet() %>% setView(lng = -81.34, lat = 41.145, zoom = 14)
m %>% addTiles()


# third party tiles using addProvider() function

m %>% addProviderTiles(providers$Stadia.StamenToner)
m %>% addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron)
m %>% addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.DarkMatter)
m %>% addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.NatGeoWorldMap)

```

Give it a shot. What do you like?


## Let's use some of our data

```{r}
parks <- sf::read_sf("../data/static_mapping/oh_parks.gpkg") %>%
  sf::st_transform(., "EPSG:4326") # transform to WGS84 to make Leaflet happy

# set up the map, zoom out a bit
mp <- leaflet(data = parks) %>% setView(lng = -81.34, lat = 41.145, zoom = 10)
mp %>% addTiles() %>% 
  addPolygons(popup = ~NAME, label = ~NAME)


```

What's the difference between popup and label?



## Lines

Who wants to help break down this code?

```{r}
portage_streams <- sf::read_sf("../data/static_mapping/tl_2022_39133_linearwater/tl_2022_39133_linearwater.shp") %>%
  sf::st_transform(., "EPSG:4326") # transform to WGS84 to make Leaflet happy

leaflet(data = portage_streams) %>% 
  setView(lng = -81.34, lat = 41.145, zoom = 10) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolylines(., color = "blue", 
               popup = ~paste0(FULLNAME, ": ", LINEARID))

```

What happened?



## Multiple layers

(Note, there's a difference here)

```{r}
m.both <- leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng = -81.34, lat = 41.145, zoom = 10) %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.NatGeoWorldMap) %>%
  addPolygons(data = parks, popup = ~NAME, label = ~NAME, color = "green") %>%
  addPolylines(data = portage_streams, color = "blue", 
               popup = ~paste0(FULLNAME, ": ", LINEARID))

m.both

```


# Let's practice

- Add the municipal boundaries in Portage and Summit counties to this map
- Give them a "popup" corresponding to their name
- And give the parks a color based on the TYPE of park.



# Team activity

- Everyone has reviewed the readings/walkthrough for this week (https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)
- Today, we will...
  1. break into teams
  2. complete tasks using Leaflet
  3. present (informally) your results, methods, challenges, etc. (maybe on Thursday)
  
- ALL DATA ARE SOMEWHERE IN THE REPOSITORY
- All tasks are included in the various readings or documentation
- For some of the extra challenges, you may need to look at the `leaflet.extras` package
  
## Tasks

### GROUP 1

- Make a choropleth map of the population density of Ohio Counties. There should be no more than 7 classes
- When the user "mouses over" a polygon, they should highlight, and a pop-up with the county name and population density should appear
- Place a legend in the bottom-right corner

#### Extra challenges: 
1. Add a minimap to the interface
2. Add a "locate me" button to the interface


### GROUP 2

- Make a map of the monitoring stations and removed dams in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed
- The monitoring stations should be symbolized as a filled, semi-transparent circle with the size scaled to the Drainage Area of the station
- Dam layer should be shaded by the year it was removed
- Add controls to turn individual layers on and off

#### Extra challenges: 
1. Use a custom icon for the dam layer
2. Add a control to the interface to change the base map
