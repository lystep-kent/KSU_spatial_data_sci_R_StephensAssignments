## Load packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(gstat)
library(SpatialKDE)
library(stars)
```
Note, examples are modified from the R Spatial Data Science book chapter on interpolation. If you want to know/read more, you can do so here: https://r-spatial.org/book/12-Interpolation.html


## read the files in
```{r}
ca.path <- "../data/ca_points/california.gpkg"
ks.path <- "../data/ca_points/ca_k_pbe.gpkg"

ca <- sf::read_sf(ca.path)
ks <- sf::read_sf(ks.path)

```


## ESDA

What are the data?
```{r}
glimpse(ks)


ks %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = pbe1415)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 40) +
  theme_minimal()

```

What other ESDA could you perform?


## Plot

Let's do some simple mapping as we would normally

```{r}
tm_shape(ca) + tm_polygons() + tm_shape(ks) + tm_dots(fill='navyblue', size = 0.1)

## Note the above controls on point fill and size. Experiment with different values

```


A more interactive way of using TMAP
```{r}
tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(ca) + tm_polygons() + tm_shape(ks) + tm_dots(fill='navyblue', size = .4)
```

set it back to plot mode

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")

tm_shape(ca) + tm_polygons() + tm_shape(ks) + tm_dots(fill='navyblue', size = .2)
```


# Interpolation

Based on your readings, how does it work???

JARGON AHOY!!!

KDE vs. IDW vs. KRIGING... ANY IDEAS?


### KDE

Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a non-parametric spatial analysis technique used to estimate the probability density function of point data over a continuous surface, effectively identifying areas of high and low concentration.

There are many different packages that can calculate a KDE. We're going to use `SpatialKDE` as an example

```{r}
# Define some initial parameters

cell_size <- 5000
band_width <- 10000
## These are probably larger than we'd typically want
## But let's keep it coarser for computation time

```


We need to setup a grid first. We'll use the California shape to get started
```{r}
grid_ca <- ca %>%
  create_grid_rectangular(cell_size = cell_size, side_offset = band_width)
```


Plot it just to check
```{r}
tm_shape(grid_ca) + tm_polygons()
```

Let's do the KDE, might take a while to run

```{r}
kde <- ks %>%
  kde(band_width = band_width, kernel = "quartic", grid = grid_ca)
```

Visualize it again

```{r}
tm_shape(kde) +
  tm_polygons(col = "kde_value", palette = "viridis", title = "KDE Estimate") 
```
### An alternative KDE with a raster data model

In this first example, we were left with a bunch of small square polygons. They LOOK like a raster image, but they're not. 

So let's instead do a KDE with a raster.

We first prepare a raster with given cell size which is slightly bigger than convex hull of the data.
```{r}
raster_ks <- ks %>%
  create_raster(cell_size = cell_size, side_offset = band_width)
```

Create the KDE (again, this may take some time)
```{r}
kde <- ks %>%
  kde(band_width = band_width, kernel = "triweight", grid = raster_ks)
```


And like before, we can plot it
```{r}
tm_shape(kde) +
  tm_raster(palette = "viridis", title = "KDE Estimate") +
  tm_shape(ks) 
```

## IDW

Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) is an interpolation technique that estimates values at unsampled locations based on the weighted average of nearby known values, with closer points having greater influence. 

Let's first start by making another grid
```{r}
grd_idw <- ca %>% 
  st_bbox(.) %>%
  st_as_stars(dx = 2500) %>%
  st_crop(., ca)


grd_idw
```
Here, we chose grid cells not too fine, so that we still see them in plots.

Perhaps the simplest interpolation method is inverse distance weighted interpolation, which is a weighted average, using weights inverse proportional to distances from the interpolation location.


Before we start, let's break down the function and notation
```{r}
idw_result <- gstat::idw(ks$pbe1415~1, ks, grd_idw)
```




In R, the ~1 notation is commonly used in modeling functions to specify an intercept-only model, meaning that no predictor variables are included. This notation appears in various contexts, including spatial interpolation `(gstat::idw())`, `regression (lm())`, and mixed-effects modeling `(lme4::lmer())`, where it indicates that predictions or estimates should be based only on a constant value (e.g., a global mean or spatial trend) rather than explanatory variables.

```{r}
ggplot() + geom_stars(data = idw_result, 
                      aes(fill = var1.pred, x = x, y = y)) + 
    xlab(NULL) + ylab(NULL) +
    geom_sf(data = st_cast(ca, "MULTILINESTRING")) #+
    #geom_sf(data = ks)
```
## Questions for thought

1. How does Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) differ from Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) in terms of what they measure and how they are used?  

2. Why does IDW assume that nearby points have more influence than distant ones, and how might this assumption be problematic in some cases?  

3. KDE produces a smooth density surface, while IDW creates an interpolated surfaceâ€”how does this difference affect their applications in spatial analysis?  

4. What are some limitations of IDW when interpolating spatial data, especially in areas with sparse or unevenly distributed points?  

## TRY WITH A PARTNER (in-class)

- How does the IDW output change if you change the bandwidth/grid size? Why does it change in the way it does?
- Try mapping a different variable. How would you do this?
